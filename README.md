  - 🧮 Apply KMeans clustering (Elbow method to find K)
  - 🧭 Label clusters and interpret segmentation insights

features:
  - ✅ Clean and minimal dataset (200 entries)
  - 🧠 Unsupervised ML with KMeans
  - 📊 Beautiful plots via Seaborn and Matplotlib
  - 💡 Interpretable clusters with practical business meaning

libraries_used:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - sklearn

getting_started:
