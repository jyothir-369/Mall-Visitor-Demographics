🛍️ Mall Visitor Demographics – Customer Segmentation Project
Analyze customer data to uncover insights that help optimize mall marketing, layout, and services.

📌 Overview
The Mall Visitor Demographics project aims to segment mall customers based on features like Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score using KMeans Clustering. These insights help mall management and retailers:

Understand different customer groups.

Target marketing campaigns more effectively.

Optimize mall layout and product offerings.

Boost footfall, sales, and customer satisfaction.

📊 Problem Statement
Retailers often lack a clear understanding of their customer base. By using data-driven segmentation, malls can:

Personalize shopping experiences.

Allocate resources based on visitor types.

Design loyalty programs for specific segments.

🔍 Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Use unsupervised learning to cluster customers.

Visualize different visitor segments.

Generate actionable insights for business decisions.

💡 Insights Gained
Identified 5 distinct clusters based on age, income, and spending.

Detected high-income, high-spending customers as prime targets.

Found young low-spending groups ideal for marketing outreach.

Suggested strategies for budget, premium, and youth segments.

🧠 Future Work
Use advanced clustering like DBSCAN or Hierarchical.

Add time-series data (footfall trends).

Integrate product purchase data for richer analysis.

Build a customer persona dashboard.
